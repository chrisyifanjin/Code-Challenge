## Problem: Create an API that return a list of "Next to jump" races.

### Description: 
It should return the race type, race number, race name, venue and the race start time. It should be ordered by race time in ascending order. See picture below of an example on how a frontend component might use the response from the API.

### Example: 


### Language: 
I am most familiar with R. However, it is a statistical programming language. I choose to use **Python** since it is a general-purpose programming language, it is more likely that more resources avaible on how to create API.
